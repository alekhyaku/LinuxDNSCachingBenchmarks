# LinuxDNSCachingBenchmarks
With the recent push for security and encrypted DNS, this report aims to identify which Linux DNS software package is best suited for encrypted DNS through a study of their caching policies. 
All the data is compiled into a spreadsheet called FinalDataDNSTesting.
Tests are written in Python. Each subfolder contains the terminal output of each test as well as the packet capture while each test was running.
